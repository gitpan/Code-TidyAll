[WARNING FOR A FUTURE RELEASE]

- At some point in the future, it will probably be necessary for Code::TidyAll
  to become aware of encodings on a per-file basis. As it stands right now,
  it's possible that any tidying plugin which reformats text could, in theory,
  end up splitting up a UTF-8 character's bytes across at a line break.

[BUG FIXES]

- Replaced the use of Capture::Tiny with IPC::Run3 for some plugins. The
  former seems to sometimes return character data where we want bytes, even if
  the STDOUT and STDERR handles are binmode()'d to the ":bytes" encoding. This
  prevents warnings about writing wide characters from the JSBeautify plugin.


0.23     2014-11-06

- Fix test failures seen on CPANTesters.


0.22     2014-11-05

[BUG FIXES]

* Removed the compile test added in the last release. Many plugin modules
  won't compile unless optional prereqs are manually installed first (such as
  Perl::Critic, Perl::Tidy, etc.).


0.21     2014-11-05

[ENHANCEMENTS]

* Test::Code::TidyAll now sets "quiet => 1" when creating the Code::TidyAll
  object to suppress noise from any plugins.

* Test::Code::TidyAll now calls Test::More::diag() after test failures instead
  of before.

[BUG FIXES]

* Lots of little doc tweaks and fixes.
